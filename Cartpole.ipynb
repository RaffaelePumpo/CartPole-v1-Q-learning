    "The Cartpole problem is a classic control problem in the field of reinforcement learning. It involves a pole that is attached to a cart, and the objective is to balance the pole upright on the cart by moving the cart left or right. The system is considered solved when the pole is balanced for a certain amount of time, or a certain number of time steps. "

    "Q-Learning is a model-free, off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm. It is used to learn the optimal policy for a given Markov Decision Process (MDP) by estimating the optimal action-value function (also known as the Q-function). The Q-function represents the expected reward for taking a specific action in a specific state and following the optimal policy thereafter. The Q-learning algorithm updates the Q-function estimates iteratively based on observed state-action transitions and received rewards. The goal of Q-learning is to find the policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward. Once the Q-function has converged, the algorithm can be used to determine the optimal policy by selecting the action with the highest Q-value for each state."
